# NameGen
This software will be in the form of a generator for parents looking for names for their future children. Some people may be overwhelmed with the reality of becoming a parent and might have a dificult time with deciding on a name. This program will allow parents to list what gender their future baby is and also pick the first letter to generate a list of different names meeting the criteria. They will be able to choose yes or no on the name and all yes names will be recorded in a list to display at the end.

# How The Program Will Run
With the software being based off a password generator, the user will be able to input the gender, as well as a letter that they might want the name to begin with. From that point, the generator will then run and generate a name that includes the two guidlines previously stated. If the user does not like the name, they are able to select "no" and allow the program to generate another name. Once they are satisfied with a generated name, the user will then type "yes" and the system will end and show the name. The process can be repeated.
